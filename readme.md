Welp, looks like I jumped ahead a bit. Anyway, here's what's accomplished so far:

COMPLETED:
- Introduction is functional
- Skip instruction/play instruction option is functional
- Computer and human player objects are being generated
- Computer and human player objects are being successfully passed in to gameplay
- The computer player is successfully generating a random array of 4 colors
- Successfully obtaining and verifying user input for answer.
- The player must enter exactly 4 of PBROGY or the answer will not be accepted and it will tell them to try again
- That guess is being stored as a variable

Comment - so far generally successful in keeping most of the code inside the module. Let's keep this up!

TODO:
- General gameplay loop
- Create answer comparison method (and sub-methods when necessary)
- Create output method for UI
- Create win/loss checks and logic
