# Mastermind

*"A game where you have to guess your opponent’s secret code within a certain number of turns. Each turn you get some feedback about how good your guess was – whether it was exactly correct or just the correct color but in the wrong space"*

## Assignment:

1. Build a Mastermind game from the command line where you have 12 turns to guess the secret code, starting with you guessing the computer’s random code

2. Now refactor your code to allow the human player to choose whether he/she wants to be the creator of the secret code or the guesser

3. Build it out so that the computer will guess if you decide to choose your own secret colors. You may choose to implement a computer strategy that follows the rules of the game or you can modify these rules
